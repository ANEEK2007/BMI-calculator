# BMI Calculator

## Description

This is a simple command-line BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python. It allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), then calculates their BMI and classifies it into categories such as "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," or "Obesity."

## Features
- **User Input:** The program prompts users to input their weight and height.
- **BMI Calculation:** The program calculates the BMI using the formula:
  
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

- **BMI Classification:** Based on the calculated BMI, the program categorizes the result into:
- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- Normal weight (18.5 <= BMI < 24.9)
- Overweight (25 <= BMI < 29.9)
- Obesity (BMI >= 30)

- **Error Handling:** Ensures valid user input for weight and height, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or higher is required to run this project.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or copy the code into a Python file.

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmi-calculator.git
 cd bmi-calculator
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
python bmi_calculator.py
Enter your details when prompted:

Weight (in kg)
Height (in meters)
The program will calculate your BMI and show the classification (e.g., "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight," "Obesity").

Example
bash
Copy code
Enter your weight (in kg): 70
Enter your height (in meters): 1.75
Your BMI is 22.86. You are classified as Normal weight.
